rsakey_tooltip="This key will be used during the signing of the certificates. The key consists of a private and a public part. Only the public part will be saved by us, the private key MUST BE saved by you to a safe place. If you lose your private key you won't be able to issue any certificate. If your private key is compromised all the certificates signed by you WILL BE REVOKED. So keep it safe and create backup copies as well. You can generate a new key (Recommended. It may take up to 3 minutes. During this the site will be unresponsive.) or import an already existing one by pasting a public key (Strict. It should only contain the public component.) into the text area."

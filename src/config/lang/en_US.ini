Only the public part will be saved by us, the private key MUST BE saved by you to a safe place. If you lose your private key you won't be able to issue any certificate. If your private key is compromised all the certificates signed by you WILL BE REVOKED. So keep it safe and create backup copies as well. You can generate a new key (recommended) or import an already existing one by pasting a public key into the text area."
